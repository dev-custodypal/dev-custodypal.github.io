Our 21-day journey across the Atlantic Ocean was one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of our lives. From the moment we left the Canary Islands, we knew we were embarking on an adventure that would test our skills, our endurance, and our relationship.

  

## The Journey Begins

  

The first few days were magical. Clear skies, steady winds, and dolphins racing alongside our boat. We quickly settled into our watch schedule, taking turns at the helm while the other rested below.

  

## Challenges at Sea

  

Around day 10, we encountered our first serious storm. Waves towered over our boat, and the wind howled through the rigging. We had to reef the sails and hunker down, trusting in our preparation and our vessel.

  

## The Reward

  

After 21 days at sea, catching our first glimpse of land in Barbados was indescribable. We had crossed an ocean using only wind and our own navigation skills. The sense of accomplishment was overwhelming.

  

This journey taught us that we're capable of far more than we ever imagined. The ocean is both beautiful and humbling, and we're grateful for every moment of this incredible adventure.
