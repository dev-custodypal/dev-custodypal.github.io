                We're Sarah and John, a couple who left our corporate jobs to sail around the world. 
                What started as a crazy dream became our reality three years ago when we bought our first sailboat.

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Neither of us knew how to sail when we first had the idea. We were working long hours, 
                stressed and unfulfilled, when we started talking about "what if we just left it all behind?"
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Two years of saving money, learning to sail, and preparing later, we sold our house, 
                quit our jobs, and set off on the adventure of a lifetime.
