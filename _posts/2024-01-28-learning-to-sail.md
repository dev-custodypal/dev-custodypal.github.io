Two years ago, neither of us had ever been on a sailboat. Today, we're living aboard and cruising full-time. This is the story of how we got here.

## The Dream

It started with a dream and a lot of YouTube videos. We were tired of the 9-to-5 grind and yearned for adventure. Sailing seemed like the perfect way to explore the world while living simply.

## Taking the Plunge

We started with a basic sailing course at our local yacht club. Our instructor was patient (which was good, because we made every rookie mistake in the book). We capsized our first dinghy, got tangled in lines, and couldn't figure out which way to turn the wheel.

## Building Confidence

But we didn't give up. We took more courses, chartered boats in different conditions, and slowly built our skills and confidence. We learned navigation, weather forecasting, boat systems, and emergency procedures.

## The Big Decision

After a year of preparation, we bought our first boat - a 35-foot cruiser that needed some work. We spent months fixing her up, learning every system intimately. This hands-on experience was invaluable.

## Setting Sail

Finally, we cast off the dock lines and started our cruising adventure. We still make mistakes and have a lot to learn, but that's part of the journey. Every day brings new challenges and new skills.

If you're dreaming of sailing, our advice is simple: start. Take that first course, charter that first boat, and see where it leads you. The ocean is waiting!
