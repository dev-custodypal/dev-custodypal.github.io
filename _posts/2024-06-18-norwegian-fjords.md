Norway's fjords are a completely different kind of sailing. Instead of tropical waters and palm trees, we found ourselves surrounded by towering mountains and dramatic landscapes.

## The Scenery

Words can't describe the beauty of these fjords. Vertical cliffs rise thousands of feet from the water, waterfalls cascade down the rock faces, and the water is so deep you can anchor just meters from the shore.

## Midnight Sun

Sailing in summer means the midnight sun. It's disorienting at first—looking at your watch and seeing midnight while the sun is still high in the sky. But it's also magical, allowing us to sail and explore at all hours.

## Unique Challenges

The fjords present unique challenges. The winds can be unpredictable, funneling through the narrow valleys. The water is cold, even in summer. And navigation requires constant attention with all the rocks and shallow areas.

## Small Villages

We anchored in tiny villages that felt untouched by time. The locals were wonderfully welcoming, and we enjoyed fresh salmon and traditional Norwegian dishes.

## A Different Kind of Paradise

The fjords aren't tropical paradise—they're raw, dramatic, and powerful. But they're equally beautiful in their own way, and this journey showed us a completely different side of sailing.

If you're looking for adventure and dramatic scenery, put Norway's fjords on your sailing bucket list.
