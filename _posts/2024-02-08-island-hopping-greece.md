Greece has always been on our sailing bucket list, and this summer we finally made it happen. Island hopping through the Cyclades was like stepping into a postcard at every turn.

## Santorini Sunsets

Our first stop was Santorini, where we anchored in the caldera and watched the famous sunset from our boat. The white buildings cascading down the cliffs, painted orange and pink by the setting sun, were even more beautiful than we'd imagined.

## Hidden Coves

The best part of traveling by boat is discovering places that most tourists never see. We found secluded coves with crystal-clear water, perfect for swimming and snorkeling. Some days we didn't see another soul.

## Local Flavors

In each island's harbor, we sampled fresh seafood, Greek salads, and local wine. The tavernas welcomed us with open arms, and we made friends with fishermen and fellow sailors from around the world.

## Mykonos Magic

Our final stop was Mykonos, where we enjoyed the vibrant nightlife before beginning our journey home. Greece captured our hearts, and we're already planning our return.
