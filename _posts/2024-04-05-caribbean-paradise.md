The Caribbean is every sailor's dream, and we spent three incredible months exploring its islands and hidden gems.

## The Water

The water here is unlike anywhere else we've sailed. It's so clear you can see the sandy bottom 30 feet below. The shades of blue and turquoise are almost unreal.

## Marine Life

We snorkeled almost every day, swimming with sea turtles, colorful fish, and even spotted a few dolphins playing in our bow wake. The coral reefs here are spectacular.

## Island Time

The pace of life in the Caribbean is wonderfully slow. We learned to embrace "island time," spending lazy afternoons in hammocks, enjoying fresh fruit from local markets, and watching incredible sunsets.

## Perfect Sailing Conditions

Steady trade winds, warm temperatures, and countless anchorages made this the easiest and most enjoyable sailing we've done. We could easily spend years here and never run out of places to explore.

The Caribbean isn't just a destination—it's a state of mind. We left a piece of our hearts in those turquoise waters.
