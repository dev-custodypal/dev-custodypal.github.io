The Atlantic crossing was something we'd been planning for years. Finally, on a crisp January morning, we set sail from the Canary Islands with our destination set for the Caribbean.

## Day 1-7: Finding Our Rhythm

The first week was all about adjustment. Getting used to the watch schedule, learning to sleep while the boat rocks, and finding our sea legs. The weather was kind to us, with steady trade winds pushing us westward.

## The Storm

On day 12, we encountered our first real challenge. A storm system that wasn't in the forecast came through, bringing 40-knot winds and 15-foot seas. It was terrifying and exhilarating all at once.

## Arrival

After 21 days at sea, spotting land was one of the most emotional moments of our lives. The Caribbean welcomed us with crystal clear waters and warm sunshine.

This journey taught us so much about sailing, about each other, and about our own resilience. It's an experience we'll treasure forever.
