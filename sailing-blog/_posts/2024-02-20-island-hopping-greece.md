Greece has always been a dream destination for sailors, and we finally made it happen this summer. Our journey through the Cyclades was nothing short of magical.

## Santorini

We started in Santorini, anchoring in the caldera with the white-washed buildings perched on cliffs above us. The sunset here is legendary, and it lived up to every expectation.

## Hidden Beaches

The best part about sailing is finding those secret spots that aren't accessible by land. We discovered countless small coves with crystal-clear turquoise water, where we had the beach entirely to ourselves.

## Local Food and Culture

Every island has its own character. We made it a point to anchor and spend time in local tavernas, trying fresh seafood and meeting the warm, welcoming people who call these islands home.

The Greek islands offer some of the best sailing in the Mediterranean, and we can't wait to return.
